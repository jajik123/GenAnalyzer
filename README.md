# GenAnalyzer

## Overview

GenAnalyzer is a web application developed using Flask, designed to simplify the analysis of protein sequences, identify mutations, and explore their potential links to genetic diseases. By integrating data from multiple sources, the application allows users to efficiently compare sequences with reference variants, making complex bioinformatics tasks more accessible.

The web application was developed as a graduate project and is available at [GenAnalyzer](https://genanalyzer.pythonanywhere.com/).

### Protein Analyzer ðŸ§¬

This tool allows users to compare a protein sequence against its reference sequence, detect mutations, and investigate their associations with human diseases.

### Advanced Sequence Aligner

This tool provides a deeper exploration of sequence alignment, offering a visual representation of how sequences are aligned. It utilizes the `Bio.Align.PairwiseAligner` class from the Biopython library to perform sequence alignment, giving the user control over the alignment process.
